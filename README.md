# Discrete fluid dynamics simulation

This is a Python simulation project that aims to provide simple model for discrete fluid dynamics simulation.

## Dependencies

Listed in the `requirements.txt` file

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LukZawadzki/SSD
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure the parameters:

  Check the `config.py` to change some simulation parameters - ranging from simulation screen size to some fluid dynamics parameters (note that some may be changed during the simulation).

4. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. Interact with the GUI and test the simulation
